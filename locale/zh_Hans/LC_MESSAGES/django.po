"This book is an adaptation of Shi Jingqian  doctoral thesis. Although the "
"book was written relatively early, I personally believe that it is its "
"pinnacle, even directly following Pursuing Modern China. As the grandfather "
"of Cao Xueqin, Cao Yin is a man who can eat both Manchu and Han.He is in "
"charge of Jiangning Weaving, and this position is not a national minister, "
"but a vassal of the emperor. In fact, he was also the ears and eyes of "
"Kangxi in Jiangnan, and everything he saw and heard had to be seen and heard "
"by Kangxi through folding.And he was also very good at being a person. When "
"Kangxi went to Jiangnan, he arranged everything properly every time, so much "
"so that Kangxi praised him highly.And behind these proper actions lies a "
"huge deficit. Although Cao Yin is very good at being a person, he cannot "
"solve this problem, which is also an important reason for the failure of the "
"Cao family.Shi Jingqian saw a large amount of information about Cao Yin and "
"Kangxi in Taiwan, which enabled him to complete this classic.The books "
"written by Shi Jingqian have a somewhat prose like flavor, and many people "
"like such writing. This book is no exception.Who does not love books that "
"are thought-provoking and beautifully written?"

"The author's last study of Tang Dynasty poetry is also his best written one. "
"It can be seen that with the experience of the previous books, this one can "
"be said to be more adept at various metaphors. The research on late Tang "
"poetry was not very developed, but the author did not step out of the scope "
"of Li, Du, and Wen, and still wandered within their circles. But "
"fortunately, with her unique perspective and a 4-year-old Chinese wife who "
"can write poetry, her works are still considered top-notch even compared to "
"those of Chinese scholars."

"This is a book about the study of pirates near Macau and Guangzhou, and it "
"is also an unparalleled book in later generations. This book is so authentic "
"that many later people believed that Lilius was posing for filming.In the "
"book, the author provides a large number of photos, including a group photo "
"of the female pirate Li Caishan and her subordinates, a group photo of the "
"author and the pirate leader, and various pirate weapons and equipment. "
"Although these photos may be somewhat blurry due to age, they are truly "
"shocking and speechless. In the book, the author provides detailed data on "
"pirate robbery from 1921 to 1929, and provides a complete description of the "
"entire process of pirate robbery in text: how pirates boarded ships, how the "
"people on board counterattacked, how British warships provided "
"reinforcements, and so on. This is completely a complete documentary. Of "
"course, sticking to the scene of pirate robbery does not solve the "
"fundamental problem. The author takes readers to see more scenes of pirate "
"life, to see pirate families, and to see their mothers and children. The "
"transition between robbery conflict and family tranquility naturally prompts "
"readers to ponder the reasons behind it."

"Also translated as The Decline of the Chinese Empire. Accustomed to reading "
"the chronicles of modern Chinese history, looking at this modern history "
"book will naturally give you a refreshing feeling. So, if it's not based on "
"time, where is the focus of the entire book? The chronological style is "
"based on time, while the biographical style is based on characters. And this "
"book is based on three social groups, namely farmers, gentry, and merchants. "
"The fundamental purpose of writing in this way is still to showcase the "
"undercurrents within society. Talking about farmers, revealing land and "
"production relations, as well as the impact on society, emphasizing the role "
"of literati groups and the elite class in society. Speaking of merchants, "
"one naturally wants to find the driving force of the economy on society and "
"the emergence of capitalism. And these three are closely linked together, "
"and on top of them, Chinese modern history is derived. Readers will "
"naturally have different feelings about the modern history written in this "
"way."
